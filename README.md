# Password_Generator

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a web page that can generate a password depending on the criterias that you want. The reason for this project was to apply the knowledge learn with javascrip so fas in the class. I learn that for every project there alwasys a better or shorter way to get to the same answer you just need to look for it a make it apply it to your project in one way or another. 

## Usage

On the webpage you will see an output box and a button. The moment you click on the generate password button it will create a password depending on the critrias prompt. The fir window will ask you how lon the password will be, do there is a minimun of 8 and a maximum of 128 characters if you decided to put a number thats not in the range the generator will tell you that not a criteria accepted. Apparte of the length the page will aslo ask you if you want to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters. Also if you dont choose at least one the generator will stop and tell you that you will need to atleast chooose one. Finally after everything is imputed in the windows it will generate a password with the criterias match and will be display in the output box on the web page.
